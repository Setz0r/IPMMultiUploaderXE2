Change Log:
===========

v1.5.x
-----------
* Minor UI improvements (icons, convert log window)
* Prevented the grid and buttons from being disabled when the upload starts
* Fix GO button: The go button will only start a file that is in "Queued", 
  "Aborted", or "Upload Failed" statuses, so clicking multiple times will not 
  cause the previous issue
* Updated Remove Buttons: Will not remove any items from the queue that are 
  processing
* Prevents dropping any files into the queue that are not JPG files
* Changed many of the error messages to make them more useful/informative
* Fixed bug when selecting no project
* Security: 
	o Added user and project info to all the Ajax calls for security on the 
	  back end (loading project/store/column list)
	o Project, column, and store lists will only display information that 
	  the user has permission to as set in the IPM Security Administrator
	o Store list is further filtered to the stores that are added to the 
	  selected project
* Progress Bar is more accurate
* More useful statuses when the file is processing
* Upload progress percentage
* Upload timeouts: time limits have been implemented to prevent hanging during 
  upload
* Monitor FTP and HTTP status codes, reports failures, and aborts the upload
* New Context Menu:
	o Abort: Abort an upload/thread after the current sub process has 
	  completed
	o Restart: Start/Restart an upload in the "Queued", "Aborted", 
	  "Canceled", or "Upload Failed" statuses
	o Cancel: Cancel an upload
* Updated convert log with more information
* Settings Dialog: Added the ability to save default application values
	o Default Site
	o Image temp directory
	o Thread Count (the amount of simultaneous uploads, 1-10)
* Option on login dialog to save login info (base64 encrypts in ini file)
* Moved site information from www.hki.com to www.hkipm.com
* Moved backend completely into the IPM
	o Project, column, and store lists come from the project panel module 
	  in the IPM
	o Posting upload to the IPM goes to the same location as uploading a 
	  file directly through the site
	o The app can now read the responses from posting a file during the 
	  upload and display them
* Each site proves the ftp host, user, pass, and port (all base64 encrypted)
